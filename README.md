# Kindle Vocab Exporter
A simple python script for exporting your new added words from *Kindle Vocabulary Builder* to **Mac**.
Just connect your Kindle and choose your favorate folder for storing output files!

For each execution, a timestamped **.csv** file and **.db** file will be generated inside this script's directory.
- The **.csv** file contains new added words delimited by space.
- The **.db** file works as a reference for next exporting. **DO NOT DELETE**.

## Work with Anki
Simply import the **.csv** file into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

Using [Fast Word Query](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1807206748) and [AwesomeTTS](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/814349176) plugins for mass querying is highly recommended!

FYI: The Anki Browse searching filter is handy. Use `deck:current Back:` to list all cards in the current deck without any definition.
